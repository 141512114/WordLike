# A "word"-like application
This is a lightweight application developed using Electron.js within an Angular framework. It functions as a simple text editor, allowing users to create, edit, and open documents.\
The idea for this project emerged from the lack of free alternatives to tools like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. However, the goal is not to compete with these comprehensive office suites. Instead, this project was designed as a learning experience to explore Angular and Electron.js.\
The initial version of this application will include a functional control panel, a document viewer, and basic text customization features. Users will be able to adjust text color, change fonts, resize text, apply styles (italic, bold, underline, etc.), and align text as needed.
