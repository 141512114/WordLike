# A "word"-like application
This is a small application made with electron.js inside angular. It should be some sort of text editor, where you can create, write and open documents.
The idea came to my mind because of the missing free alternatives to OpenOffice and LibreOffice. This project won't compete with them, it was made just to
learn a bit angular and electron.js.
